## About me

I am a second-year master student majored in computer science and engineering in Beihang university. I am expected to graduate at the end of 2024 and currently applying for a PhD.

I am an "advocate" (INFJ) person, idealistic, passionate about life, enthusiastic about scientific research. I always want to get rid of the appearance of things to get to the essence, and devote the full of myself to it.

My current research interests include knowledge tracing, recommendation, graph learning, uncertainty.
